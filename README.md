## AWS Precompiled Lambda Layers for Amazon Linux 2

After searching around for a few hours, I cannot seem to find what I'm looking for and the documentation on this subject is non-existent.

I needed access to the package in a lambda function however I have been unsuccessful finding  the pandas and numpy packages for usage in a Lambda function.

So i decided to build the libraries myself to support he Amazon Linux 2 arch.
